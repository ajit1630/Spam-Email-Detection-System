**Spam Email Detection System:-**
The Spam Email Detection System is a machine learning project that classifies email content as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" using various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.
The system includes a Flask-based web interface for users to input email text and receive predictions in real time.

**Overview:-**
This project leverages machine learning to detect spam emails. Using techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text feature extraction and
models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the system achieves high accuracy in spam classification.
The project is hosted locally with Flask and allows users to test emails by submitting the text via a web interface.

**Technologies:-**
-Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, Flask)
-Flask (for the web interface)
-AWS EC2 (for deployment)
-Machine Learning Models:
-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-Frontend: HTML, CSS

**Features:-**
-User-friendly interface to input email text.
-Real-time spam detection using pre-trained models.
-Models trained on a large email dataset for high accuracy.
-Achieved over 95% accuracy with the SVM model.
